### Key Files
- **`main.py`**: The main entry point for running the Streamlit app.
- **`requirements.txt`**: Contains the dependencies required to run the project.
- **`Linear_regression_projects/`**: Contains individual project scripts and datasets.

## Projects Included

1. **Messi Goal Prediction**  
   Predicts the number of goals Messi will score based on the number of matches played using Linear Regression.

2. **House Price Prediction**  
   Predicts house prices based on their sizes using Linear Regression.

3. **Study Hours and Exam Prediction**  
   Predicts exam scores based on the number of hours studied using Linear Regression.

4. **Normal Equation vs Gradient Descent**  
   Compares the performance of the Normal Equation and Gradient Descent methods for solving Linear Regression problems.

5. **Salary Prediction**  
   Predicts salaries based on years of experience using Linear Regression.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/benasphy/ML_projects.git
   cd LinearRegression
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the Streamlit app:
   ```bash
   streamlit run main.py
   ```

4. Select a project from the sidebar to explore its functionality.

## Requirements

The project requires the following Python libraries:
- `streamlit`
- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `scikit-learn`
- `matplotlib`

## Datasets

- **`diabetes.csv`**: Contains data for predicting diabetes outcomes based on various health metrics.

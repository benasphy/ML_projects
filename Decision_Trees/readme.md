### Key Files
- **`main.py`**: The main entry point for running the Streamlit app.
- **`requirements.txt`**: Contains the dependencies required to run the project.
- **`Decision_Tree_projects/`**: Contains individual project scripts.

## Projects Included

1. **Gym Decision Tree**  
   Predicts whether a person will go to the gym based on their energy level and motivation using a Decision Tree.  
   - Visualizes the decision tree.
   - Allows user input to predict gym attendance.

2. **Gini Impurity Implementation**  
   Demonstrates the use of Gini Impurity to build a Decision Tree for predicting gym attendance.  
   - Visualizes the decision tree.
   - Allows user input to predict gym attendance.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/benasphy/ML_projects.git
   cd Decision_Tree
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the Streamlit app:
   ```bash
   streamlit run main.py
   ```

4. Select a project from the sidebar to explore its functionality.

## Requirements

The project requires the following Python libraries:
- `streamlit`
- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `scikit-learn`
- `matplotlib`
